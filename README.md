# List of to-do's (in order of importance)



WORK ON UPLOADING SONGS WITH 'upload.php' CQCQCQ

WORK ON THE SEARCH FUNCTION FOR SONGS/MUSIC_BOXES  (both the search songs that are uploaded to github, and hopefully find a way to play songs off the web) XQXQXQ

MAKE MUSIC BOXES FOR SONGS THAT DON'T HAVE MUSIC BOXES XQXQXQ

PLACE MORE SONGS IN THE 'Music to Add' GOOGLE DOCS

(wait for a little while)PLACE THE SONGS IN 'for_HENRY' IN ACTUAL PAGES XQXQXQ

(Figure Out How to Adjust PAGE BASED ON SCREEN SIZE, (PHONE, TABLET, MONITOR, ETC))
