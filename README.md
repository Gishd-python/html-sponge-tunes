List of to-do's (in order of importance)



WORK ON UPLOADING SONGS WITH 'upload.php'

WORK ON THE SEARCH FUNCTION FOR SONGS/MUSIC_BOXES  (both the search songs that are uploaded to github, and hopefully find a way to play songs off the web)

MAKE MUSIC BOXES FOR SONGS THAT DON'T HAVE MUSIC BOXES

PLACE MORE SONGS IN THE 'Music to Add' GOOGLE DOCS

(wait for a little while)PLACE THE SONGS IN 'for_HENRY' IN ACTUAL PAGES
